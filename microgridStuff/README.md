# Introduction to Hacking a Microgrid

Microgrids are pretty high maintenance, and like satellites, primarily built for survivability, not security. As the Department of Defense marches toward deploying microgrids at scale to shore up mission resilience in response to the challenges presented by climate change, hackers are gonna hack.

In this lab, you’ll learn the basics of microgrid design – from what they are, how they work, and how they regulate themselves. Then, you’ll be able to use this knowledge to then attempt to take over and shut down a mock microgrid by hacking its weather data system and sensor input network to generate chaos.

## Why This Matters

In today’s world, the big power grid is becoming less reliable with large, sustained outages occurring at a greater frequency than ever before. The big power grid has also become a single point of failure, vulnerable due to aging infrastructure, the impacts of climate change, and cyber attacks. When the grid goes down, States, civilian communities and military bases are severely impacted. For example, the deadly Texas storm in Feb 2021 that resulted in the death of at least 240 people and more recently, Russian hackers hitting German wind energy companies in response to the European transition away from Russian fuel.
